# What went well
For me what went well was the process of setting everything up such as the sql script for the database,
the feature files and setting up the dependencies.  To make sure everything was going correctly I reference the
videos that were going over the setup of the project.  In the past I usually miss a step when setting up projects,
and so I took time to go over lectures so that it doesn't happen this time.

# What needs to be improved upon 
While working on this first project I got fixated on a bug that I couldn't figure out, and so I spent a lot of 
time trying to fix the bug while I could've been working on other parts of my project such writing this
sprint retrospective or the acceptance testing summary.  Because of that I got behind on this project.  Another
thing that needs to be worked on is organization skills of writing the steps for the feature files and implementing those
steps, in the begging of working this project I found myself first fixing the features files as all of them had bugs such as missing
brackets for the examples section and missing keywords like "Scenario".  Lastly organizing my methods in my code
when writing code I saw that many of my methods were really similarly, and so I could've combined two methods into 1. 
For example, I had a method called setupValidPlanetInfo() and other one called setUpInvalidPlanetInfo(), looking back
I could've combined these two methods into one method so that my code is not littered one use methods.

# What needs to be completed next sprint
While I believe I am not missing anything in the project requirements, the only thing I can think of is not 
fixing the bug. In my project I still ended up not figuring out the bug I was fixating on and so for next time I need to remember
to work on the other parts of the project, so I can get those parts get finished so that I can hopefully I will have more time
to work on that bug and fix it.
