# As a new user I want to open an account with the Planetarium, so I can save my celestial findings
- Grade: 3 A simple registration page does what it needs to do.  Webpage provides a username input
and a password input with a button to submit the credentials.  While it is simple it could've gotten a 
rating of 4 if the user interface was a bit more modern and if the webpage tells the user what the requirements
are when making a username and password.

Is the intended use of the service intuitive?
- For this particular user story I can confidently say that it's service is intuitive for me.  
  I have been to many registration pages, and they all follow a similar format where you provide
  a username/email than a password associated with username/email.  The registration page for the
  planetarium although a simple design follows the basics of what a login page should have.

Is the service easy to use?
- Registration for the planetarium is easy to use.  When a user goes to the registration page they are
prompted to enter a username and password once the user does that they can submit the credentials and will be
taken to their home page.  My only gripe is that the registration page does not tell you what are the username and
password requirements.  A username might enter a username and not even know if it's a valid username or not and vice 
versa for password.

Does the service inspire confidence?
- For being a simple registration page it gets the job done as any other registration page.  In today's age many website's require
users to register to get the homepage of the service that there using, many users expect the registration pages to work because that is
the norm today and so the planetarium registration follows the norm today mostly.  There is one defect that happens when a user provides a
username that is already taken, the page will not give an alert message which will cause confusion to the user as he doesn't
know what is going on with the application

Is the service pleasing to look at?
- Looking the registration page I can see that nothing is pleasing to look at, however it is also not unsightly to look at.
The page follows a simple design pattern and while there is nothing wrong with a simple design pattern, users might get the
idea that the planetarium website is a made in mid 2000's

# As a user I want to securely access my account, so I can interact with the Planetarium in a secure environment
- Grade: 3  simple to use feature, only requires a username and password to login.  Feature works as expected with proper 
alert given when user provides invalid credentials.  Although a basic login feature it gets the jobs done, would be given a four
if maybe there were more security features and a user interface overhaul.

Is the intended use of the service intuitive?
- For logging in, I would say that this feature is intuitive because it does what I need it to and for this feature
that would the act of logging in.  The webpage displays a username input, password input and a login button.  With these
self-explanatory inputs users can see what they need to provide in order to login.

Is the service easy to use?
- This service is easy to use because of the fact it only uses 3 simple inputs to complete.  Nowadays websites require 
users to login in order to access the features of the homepage and this login does that.  

Does the service inspire confidence?
- Yes this service inspires confidence but not by much as it looks like it's a basic website, however It does what a user needs it to do and that's to log in the user so that can have access
to the home page features.  As of right now this feature always delivers its service.

Is the service pleasing to look at?
- the user interface for the login feature as a simple design that is neither pleasing to look at nor unsightly to look at.
The design for this feature follows a simple pattern of 1 color in the background with white color text and simple 
input design for username and password.  Similar to the registration page I believe users would mistake this page to be created
in the mid 2000's as most other website have a modern feel to them.

# As a user I want to see my planets and moons added to the Planetarium, so I can track my findings
- Grade: 3 When a user is logged in they are able to see all of their planets and moons just like the user says.  While the webpage looks 
bare bones it gets the job done of letting the user view their resources and not letting a user who is not logged in view resources on the 
homepage.

Is the intended use of the service intuitive?
- Yes when the user is logged in they are provided with their planets and moons resources so that they can verify 
that all resources are there.  

Is the service easy to use?
- Yes because all a user needs to do is when they are logged in they can verify themselves if all of their plants and
moons are present on their home page, this allows the users to fulfil all user story 3's features.  

Does the service inspire confidence?
- yes because similar to the easy-to-use point all the user has to do is look at the home page to see if their planets
and moons are present on their page and if not they can take the appropriate actions to fix their findings.

Is the service pleasing to look at?
- No the service is not pleasing to look at because with the addition to looking at moons and planets elements comes
more styling choices and the choices make the website seem ancient, now if this is what the creator of the website
was going for then I suppose he achieved his choice of style however that does not discredit the fact that the website
looks ancient

# As a user I want to add new planets and moons to the Planetarium, so I can update my findings

- Grade: 2 When a user wants to add new planets and moons for the most part they can do that however if they try
to add a photo that is not in the JPEG/PNG format they will not be able to do so.  Now this sounds normal however
the webpage will not give out an alert letting the user know if they provided a wrong file type and so
the website will sit there waiting for the user to provide a valid file type.  When user does provide a valid file
type they will be able to see the newly added resource on their home page

Is the intended use of the service intuitive?
- Yes when a user is on the home page they can clearly see all the options that are laid out for them for crating a 
planet or moon.  For planet there is one input form and for moon there is two input form followed but a submit button.
Once user provides valid information they are able to submit the form and see the newly added planet and or moon.


Is the service easy to use?
- Yes the service is easy to use because as stated before a user only needs to provide 1 form for submitting planets 
and 2 forms for submitting a moon.  There is also a scroll bar on the right side of the page that the user can use
to view all other planets and moons.


Does the service inspire confidence?
- Yes the service inspires confidence because a user can keep track of what moons are owned by planets using an Orbital ID.
With this feature it will confidently provide a user with information regarding their moon and the associated planet id.
the feature also allows for users to add photos to their planets or moons so that the planets and moons can be more
descriptive.  With all this there are 2 defects, 1 for adding a planet with a wrong file type and 1 for adding a 
moon with a wrong file type.  The feature does not provide any alert for when an invalid file type is provided
for planets and moons besides that the feature still displays confidence.

Is the service pleasing to look at?
- No because it has the same problem in user story 3 where when there are more elements in the page the more styling choices
need to be made and the choices that were made gave the webpage a feeling that the webpage was made in the mid 2000's.
The font for the webpage doesn't also help with how the page looks and the size of the font for the planet and moons names 
makes it hard to read.

# As a user I want to remove planets and moons from the Planetarium, so I can correct my findings
- Grade 3: When a user provides a valid name for a planet or moon, they should be able to delete that resource and should not 
be able to see that resource on their homepage.  This feature was successfully implemented I did not see any defects while
testing this user story, lastly my only gripe is the user interface for the feature other than that the feature did what it
was supposed to do.

Is the intended use of the service intuitive?
- Yes the user can see where they can input information to delete the planet and or moon and the button to submit the information.
Although the font is small users are able to see the prevalent information to delete their planet or moon.

Is the service easy to use?
- Yes the service is easy to use, a user only needs to select option to whether delete a planet or moon,
and then they need to provide a valid name for the planet or moon and press the submit button to delete that 
resource.  

Does the service inspire confidence?
- Yes, so far no defects have been found regarding deletion of planets and moons.  When valid info is submitted for plants
and moons the following table shows no resource of that planet that was entered.  I tested this feature multiple times (around 50 times)
and each time it did what it was supposed to do.

Is the service pleasing to look at?
- No the service is not pleasing to look at because as stated in the other user story points the styling can use an overhaul.
Most of webpages today give a modern feel while the planetarium website looks like it was made 15 years ago and while the function
of the website still functions correctly it can still benefit from an overhaul on the user interface.  The fonts on the webpage could be bigger
so that it is easier to see the text on the webpage.
